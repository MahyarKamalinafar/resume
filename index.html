          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p class="project-management-desc">
            Projects have been my life blood for most of my career. From the
            start as I learned VBA I managed small process improvement projects
            to make my life easier to now managing organization wide projects
            with multiple highlevel stakeholders, integrations, and consultants.

          <h3>Process Automation and Enhancement Solution Design</h3>
          <p class="solutions-design-desc">
            In every position I always search for the most reliable and speedy
            way of accomplishing tasks. I began my automation and solution
            design journey for small analyst level processes and expanded it to
            designing and automating onboarding and offboarding for our
            organization.

          <h3>Agile</h3>
          <p class="agile-desc">
            Early 2022 I officially obtained my Product Owner certification from
            Agile Learning Labs. Our team had previously implemented loose
            agile, but this was my first foray into Agile. After experiencing
            the power of agile I have become a staunch advocate of the tools it
            provides teams to better manager their projects and stakeholders.

          <h3>Software</h3>
          <p class="softwares-desc">
            Excel was my lifeblood for many years to design processes. From
            complex formulas to VBA to PowerQuery/DataModel I have built excel
            solutions of everysize. Yet even Excel has its limits, so I have had
            to expand to Python, Power Automate, SharePoint, MS Forms,
            ServiceNow and now to Full Stack web development.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Mass Mailer</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          A custom VBA tool that allows a user to send custom bulk emails. They
          are able to customize the body with variables, attach unqiue and
          general files, input excel tables into the body of the email, send
          from shared mailboxes, and setup templates to make it repetitive.
        </p>

        <h3>Time Allocation</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          A custom VBA tool which allows teams to specify parameters for their
          team members to enter in time and allocate to multiple allocations.
          All data is encrypted and easily accessible to management for review
          of how their team allocates their time.
        </p>

        <h3>Onboarding and Offboarding</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Solutioned using Forms/Power Automate/Sharepoint, a simplified and
          automated onboarding and offboarding proccess for a medium-large sized
          international organization (3-5k team members). This helped reduce
          confusion (previous process was disparate) and allowed for
          auditability and reliability.
        </p>

        <h3>Timecard Calculations</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          Built in Python using Numpy and Pandas, a custom overtime and timecard
          calculation module that allows use by multiple tools to calculate
          overtime and total timecard hours for client facing payroll.
        </p>

        <h3>Customer Service Portal</h3>
        <p class="project-desc">
          As a Product Owner for our ServiceNow instance, I have been working
          with stakeholders to design and implement the Customer Service Module
          for a large customer base accross multiple teams. This includes
          Knowledge Bases, Virtual Agent, Record Producers, Agent Experience and
